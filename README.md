## Usage

### Fetching and Chaining Transcripts

The **Get Transcripts List** operation retrieves a list of available meeting transcripts based on optional filters such as:

- `organizer_email`
- `participant_email`
- `host_email`
- `title`
- `user_id`
- `from_date` / `to_date`

This is often the first step in building a workflow, allowing you to dynamically retrieve and iterate over multiple transcript records.

Once you have the transcript IDs from this operation, you can pass them as inputs to the following operations:

- **Get Transcript**: Fetch the full transcript content.
- **Get Transcript Summary**: Retrieve [summary](https://docs.fireflies.ai/schema/summary) and key takeaways.
- **Get Transcript Analytics**: Access [analytics](https://docs.fireflies.ai/schema/analytics) like sentiment, topic extraction, and more.

These operations can be chained together to create rich workflows for reporting, insights, or downstream automation.
